# context-aware-time-prediction
Source code for reference of the article "Context-Aware Completion Time Prediction for Business Process Monitoring" by Renato Alves, Luciana Babrieri, Kleber Stroeh. Sarajane Marque Perez and Edmundo Roberto Mauro Madeira. The code here presents the application of contextual information into process mining predictive task. This code can performe the following task:

ATS: 
- Training an Annotated Transition Systems using an context-enriched eventlog.
- Predict the remaining time.

LSTM:
- Training an LSTM with an context-enriched eventlog.
- Predict the remaining time and the continuation (suffix) of an incomplete business process trace.
